[COLOR red][B]Online Release Version 1.0.55[/B][/COLOR]
- Added Easynews image search.
- Added ability to bind Fen Light's Extras dialog and Options dialog to specific keys/buttons for quick access. This would be done instead of letting Fen Light replace Kodi's Information and Context Menu dialogs as is currently an option. The command for opening the extras dialog is "RunPlugin(plugin://plugin.video.fenlight/?mode=custom_key_extras_menu_choice)", and the Options dialog is "RunPlugin(plugin://plugin.video.fenlight/?mode=custom_key_options_menu_choice)". Restart Kodi if you add these to a keymap.
- Added Settings->Content->Content->"Control Viewtypes within Addon". If your skin is able (through a helper script) to handle "locking" viewtypes, then this functionality in Fen Light can likely be turned OFF as it may not be needed.
- Adedd Settings->Content->Content->"Shuffle Order of Personal/Liked Trakt Lists" to same settings menu.
- Fixed Trakt lists not loading if there is an instance of type: person within the list.
- Other changes/fixes.
